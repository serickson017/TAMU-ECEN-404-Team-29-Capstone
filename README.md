This is a collection of code and relevant datasheets for the Automated Greenhouse Project, organized by subsystem. Samuel Erickson was in charge of the MCU and Sensors,
Chandler Kramer was in Charge of the Power, and Mengtian Ke was in charge of the Wifi board and Client Interface.

In order to run the code on the MCU, use energia, and make sure you target the correct board. Sensors and should be connected to the specified pins found in the code.
